  "bio": "I am a full stack developer with more then 3 years of experience. I specialize in development using React.js and Next.js on the frontend and Node.js and Express on the backend. During the covid pandemic, I decided to change my career and devote myself fully to programming, which until then was only my hobby. It's a job that fulfills me and I can't imagine doing anything else. I also have more than 8 years of experience in analytical positions. I can analyze and propose solutions to complex problems, deal with clients and then process their requirements, and last but not least, manage diverse projects. I am able to work efficiently, and independently and I like to learn new things."
